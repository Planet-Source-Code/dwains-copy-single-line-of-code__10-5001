## Copy single line of code


</div>

### Description

I just found a neat little feature in VB.Net. So many time a programmer copies code from one form to the next, did you know that you can copy a single line of code without highlighting the whole line.

### Source Code

Simply select the line by going to the beginning of the line click the mouse once select copy and paste the single line of code to the desired location. I thought this was worth sharing because so many times I go to highlight the line and select more than was needed and have to start again.
